## Introduction
The Game is designed to participate in [lvl99 GameJam] (https://itch.io/jam/lv-99-game-jam). The current gamejam theme is "Take a deep breath", so We decided to focus on ideas related to fighting everyday stress in single-player casual gameplay. To make it possible to finish our game in a limited amount of time, game is created using Unity engine with entirely self-made art and assets.
