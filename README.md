# StressedOut
 
## Introduction
The Game is designed to participate in [lvl99 GameJam](https://itch.io/jam/lv-99-game-jam). The current gamejam theme is "Take a deep breath", so We decided to focus on ideas related to fighting everyday stress in single-player casual gameplay. To make it possible to finish our game in a limited amount of time, the game is created using the Unity engine with entirely self-made art and assets. 

## Technical specs
Unity C# project for singleplayer, arcade, WebGL game.

## Gameplay
Input: mouse movement + LMB to take a deep breath and relieve stress and RMB for holding breath to make cursors smaller. 
Stress level is shown in a bar on the right side, game progress is shown in a bar on the left side.
Stressful events/enemies have different behaviours of movement.

## Design
2d, vector digital artwork.
